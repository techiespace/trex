# Python Trex bot
This code was written a while ago and it requires Python libraries that only work on Windows.

## Logic

- We take rapid screenshots of whatever is being displayed.
- I determined which coordinate corresonds to the obstacle being close to our Trex.
- I took a screenshot of the full screen and determined the coordinates by opening the image in Paint.NET.
- Then we check if a specific pixel color changes at these coordinates which triggers a jump.  

## Platform & Dependencies

- Works only on **Windows**.
- Paint.NET to figure out the coordinates of obstacles.
### Python dependencies
|Library                          |Installation                         |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|library_name            |`pip3 install library_name`            |
|library_name            |`pip3 install library_name`            |
|library_name            |`pip3 install library_name`			 |

Note: I lost the python version on my old pc, will upload it soon.
